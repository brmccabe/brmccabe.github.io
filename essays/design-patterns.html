<p>Being able to identify problems during development and knowing the appropriate pattern design to apply is a skill that is important for programmers.  Software developers that are familiar with the various pattern designs will have to have to think less about how to structure their code and they can be confident in how they’ve structured their code </p>

<p>I have been learning about pattern designs in my software engineering class this week.  What I have realized while learning about them is that I have been using some of them without knowing what they were.  One of the pattern designs that we covered was the Model-View-Controller pattern.  I have been using this pattern in my software engineering class for the past few weeks while working on a <a href=” http://fityonder.meteorapp.com/#/”>website</a> for a group project.  Hopefully I haven’t been using anti design patterns without realizing it too.  I plan to better familiarize myself with design patterns in order to make future projects more manageable.</p>
